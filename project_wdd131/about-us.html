      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>CineWatch</strong> — your ultimate gateway to the world of television entertainment.

      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to make your viewing choices smarter, easier, and way more fun. Whether you're hunting
        for your next binge-worthy drama or want to share thoughts about your favorite episodes, CineWatch is the
        platform for you.
      </p>

      <h2>How It All Started</h2>
      <p>
        It all began with a late-night group chat where we couldn’t decide what to watch. Out of frustration
        (and a little too much caffeine), CineWatch was born — with the goal to end endless scrolling and help
        users discover shows they’ll love.
      </p>

      <h2>A Little Fun History</h2>
      <p>
        Our first prototype was drawn on a pizza box (true story). The name “CineWatch” was decided during
        a heated debate while waiting for WiFi to reconnect. And yes — one team member still believes reality
        shows are a form of enlightenment.
      </p>
