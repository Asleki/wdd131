                        <p>Welcome to CineWatch! We're thrilled you're here. Our journey began with a simple idea: to create a dedicated space for TV show enthusiasts to discover, stream, and celebrate their favorite series.</p>
                        <p>It all started back in **2024**, in a small apartment in Mlolongo, Machakos County, Kenya. Our founder, **Alex Malunda**, was having a particularly intense TV show marathon. Frustrated with endlessly searching across various platforms and battling buffering screens (a common Nairobi issue, as you might know!), a thought sparked: "There has to be a better way!" What began as a passion project, fueled by countless cups of coffee and late-night coding sessions, quickly grew into something more. We envisioned a platform that wasn't just about watching shows, but about building a community where every click felt like coming home to your next binge-worthy adventure.</p>
                        <p>We've poured our hearts into building CineWatch to be intuitive, comprehensive, and above all, a joy to use. We believe that finding your next favorite show should be as entertaining as watching it!</p>
